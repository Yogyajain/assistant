At times SwDs are deprived of harnessing their latent skills and thereby miss the
opportunity. This scheme aims to support SwDs to study further in order to prepare
themselves to earn their livelihood and to find a dignified place for themselves in the
society as they face several barriers physical, financial, psychological, mental in
pursuing studies and living with dignity.
